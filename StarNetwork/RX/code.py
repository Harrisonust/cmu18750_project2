CircuitPython Feather RP2040 RFM95 Packet Receive Demo

This demo waits for a "button" packet. When the first packet is received, the NeoPixel LED
lights up red. The next packet changes it to green. The next packet changes it to blue.
Subsequent button packets cycle through the same colors in the same order.

This example is meant to be paired with the Packet Send Demo code running
on a second Feather RP2040 RFM95 board.
